# Project 1 Overview - Name List
 This project creates a custom linked list structure.
 It serves as an exercise in working with linked lists and nodes.
the [main program is here](https://github.com/alanperez/CS3345-Data-Structures-and-Introduction-to-Algorithmic-Analysis/blob/main/Project1/NameList.java)

# Project 2 Overview - GuessingGame

the [main program is here](https://github.com/alanperez/CS3345-Data-Structures-and-Introduction-to-Algorithmic-Analysis/blob/main/Project2-BST/MySearchTree.java)

   Create a class called MySearchTree.  MySearchTree will implement a binary
   search tree.  MySearchTree will be a generic class storing a value of the
   generic type.

  
  
# Project 3 Overview - Linear Probing Hash Table

The [requirements based off the document]()

This notebook demonstrates the basic skills of using WordNet and SentiWordNet

# Project 4 Overview - External Sort
Description:

     Create a class called ExternalSort.

     Your class should have the following methods.  You may add additional methods as needed.

     You may use code from the textbook, but all other code must be your own.


   80 points
   a) public static Path extsort(Path t1, int runsize)

          Uses the external sort procedure illustrated in chapter 7 to sort the file represented
          by Path t1 using the passed size as the run size and returns a Path to the sorted result.

          For the tapes, use files named T1-T4.  The data should already be on T1 when this method
          is called.  You can assume the data consists of Integers.

          Your sort should work even if the number of input items is not a multiple of the run size.

          Note that "Path" is an object in Java's "java.nio.file" package.



   20 points
   b) public static void main(String args[])

          Accepts run size as a command line argument.
          Assumes input already exists on a file named T1.
          Calls the external sort routine.
          Prints the Path object which gives the path to the sorted file.





To run this program, you must have the text file in the same directory as the main program
